# Visualization-of-NCBI-ALFA-Variants

NCBI ALFA aims to provide genetic variation and allele frequency from more than 1 million subjects in the Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes. ALFA is a large population genomic variant dataset but its sheer scale and richness can be challenging or unwieldy for users. Developing new approaches for complex analysis, navigation, and visualization of ALFA can maximize usage of the ALFA data by the community for variant interpretation for clinical and research use. The primary goal of this project is to develop a novel tool app, tool, or approach to navigation and visualization of NCBI ALFA variants and allele frequency for 12 different human populations.
